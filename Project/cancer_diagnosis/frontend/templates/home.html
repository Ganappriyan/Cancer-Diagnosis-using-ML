  <h1>Cancer Diagnosis using Machine Learning</h1>
  <p class="lead">This project aims to diagnose cervical cancer using machine learning algorithms. We have trained our
    models to detect Dyskeratotic, Koilocytic, Metaplastic, Parabasal, Superficial-Intermediate cells in cervical smear
    images, and classify them into one of four categories: High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), Low-grade
    squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), Negative for intraepithelial malignancy, and Squamous cell carcinoma.</p>

          <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
            <li class="list-group-item"><b>Dyskeratotic:</b> Dyskeratotic cells are characterized by abnormal
              keratinization. They can be a sign of inflammation or damage to the epithelial tissue, and may be seen in
              certain types of cancer.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><b>Koilocytic:</b> Koilocytic cells are characterized by a clear halo around the
              nucleus. They are often caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and can be a sign of precancerous or
              cancerous changes.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><b>Metaplastic:</b> Metaplastic cells are normal cells that have undergone
              changes
              in response to injury or inflammation. They can be a sign of a benign or malignant process.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><b>Parabasal:</b> Parabasal cells are immature cells that are normally found in
              the basal layer of the epithelium. They can be a sign of inflammation, infection, or precancerous changes.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><b>Superficial-Intermediate:</b> Superficial-Intermediate cells are cells that
              have begun to differentiate and move towards the surface of the epithelium. They can be a sign of
              inflammation or infection, but are usually not associated with cancer.</li>

              human

              cells in the epithelium. It can be aggressive and may spread to other parts of the body.</li>
